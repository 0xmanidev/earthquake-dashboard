# Earthquake Dashboard

A simple Python Tkinter application that visualizes recent earthquake activity using live USGS data and maintains a persistent history.

## Features

- Shows the latest 50 earthquakes in a sortable table
- Plots magnitude over time
- Displays a log-scaled energy distribution
- Stores history across runs

---

## Requirements

Install the dependencies using:

```

requests
matplotlib
numpy

```

These are included in `requirements.txt`.

---

## Installation & Running

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install required packages:

```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

3. Run the dashboard:

```

python main.py

```

---

## Notes

- Tkinter is included with most Python installations.
- On first run, a history file (`earthquake_history.json`) will be created in your AppData (Windows) so your graphs fill in over time.
